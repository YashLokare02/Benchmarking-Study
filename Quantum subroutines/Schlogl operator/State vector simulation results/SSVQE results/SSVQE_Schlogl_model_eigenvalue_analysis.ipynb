    "    r\"\"\"The Subspace Search Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm.\n",
    "    `SSVQE <https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09434>`__ is a hybrid quantum-classical\n",
    "    algorithm that uses a variational technique to find the low-lying eigenvalues\n",
    "    of the Hamiltonian :math:`H` of a given system. SSVQE can be seen as\n",
    "    a natural generalization of VQE. Whereas VQE minimizes the expectation\n",
    "    value of :math:`H` with respect to the ansatz state, SSVQE takes a set\n",
    "    of mutually orthogonal input states :math:`\\{| \\psi_{i}} \\rangle\\}_{i=0}^{k-1}`,\n",
    "    applies the same parameterized ansatz circuit :math:`U(\\vec\\theta)` to all of them,\n",
    "    then minimizes a weighted sum of the expectation values of :math:`H` with respect\n",
    "    to these states.\n",
    "\n",
    "    An instance of SSVQE requires defining four algorithmic sub-components:\n",
    "\n",
    "    An :attr:`estimator` to compute the expectation values of operators, an integer ``k`` denoting\n",
    "    the number of eigenstates that the algorithm will attempt to find, an ansatz which is a\n",
    "    :class:`QuantumCircuit`, and one of the classical :mod:`~qiskit.algorithms.optimizers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The ansatz is varied, via its set of parameters, by the optimizer, such that it works towards\n",
    "    a set of mutually orthogonal states, as determined by the parameters applied to the ansatz,\n",
    "    that will result in the minimum weighted sum of expectation values being measured\n",
    "    of the input operator (Hamiltonian) with respect to these states. The weights given\n",
    "    to this list of expectation values is given by ``weight_vector``. An optional array of\n",
    "    parameter values, via the ``initial_point``, may be provided as the starting point for\n",
    "    the search of the low-lying eigenvalues. This feature is particularly useful such as\n",
    "    when there are reasons to believe that the solution point is close to a particular\n",
    "    point. The length of the ``initial_point`` list value must match the number of the\n",
    "    parameters expected by the ansatz being used. If the ``initial_point`` is left at the\n",
    "    default of ``None``, then SSVQE will look to the ansatz for a preferred value, based\n",
    "    on its given initial state. If the ansatz returns ``None``, then a random point will\n",
    "    be generated within the parameter bounds set, as per above. If the ansatz provides\n",
    "    ``None`` as the lower bound, then SSVQE will default it to :math:`-2\\pi`; similarly,\n",
    "    if the ansatz returns ``None`` as the upper bound, the default value will be :math:`2\\pi`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    An optional list of initial states, via the ``initial_states``, may also be provided.\n",
    "    Choosing these states appropriately is a critical part of the algorithm. They must\n",
    "    be mutually orthogonal because this is how the algorithm enforces the mutual\n",
    "    orthogonality of the solution states. If the ``initial_states`` is left as ``None``,\n",
    "    then SSVQE will automatically generate a list of computational basis states and use\n",
    "    these as the initial states. For many physically-motivated problems, it is advised\n",
    "    to not rely on these default values as doing so can easily result in an unphysical\n",
    "    solution being returned. For example, if one wishes to find the low-lying excited\n",
    "    states of a molecular Hamiltonian, then we expect the output states to belong to a\n",
    "    particular particle-number subspace. If an ansatz that preserves particle number\n",
    "    such as :class:`UCCSD` is used, then states belonging to the incorrect particle\n",
    "    number subspace will be returned if the ``initial_states`` are not in the correct\n",
    "    particle number subspace. A similar statement can often be made for the\n",
    "    spin-magnetization quantum number.\n",
